Manages information about baseball players.

Represents each player by a 'player-info' tuple containing:
    playerâ€™s name (of type str)
    team identifier (of type str)
    games played (of type int)
    at bats (of type int)
    runs scored (of type int)
    hits (of type int)
    homeruns (of type int)
    batting average (of type float)
    
The first seven items are read from a file and the last is calculated.
All are of the type indicated.

Represents the data on all players in a file as a list of player-info tuples.

Input files:
A comment line begins with '#'.  A legal non-comment line contains the first
seven items one player; a semi-colon separates items. (See mlb.test.txt,
mlb.2013.txt)
